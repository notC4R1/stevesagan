This repository will be used to store my personal projects and track my progress as I develop my skillset.

Projects:

WTFTW: A tool to help reduce the amount of time we take choosing a movie to watch. This project uses the free API from TheMovieDB. The API key will be exposed in the front end, however, it is read-only. A movie list is pulled and each request is organized by popularity on TheMovieDB. User input on the left will manipulate the request to match the selected genres and display the appropriate movie titles. An object is created from each movie title in the request, and key properties will be appended to the object. These properties, including the movie poster, will then be used to populate each DIV which will then be drawn onto the web page. Finally, a function will run for a short amount of time and will generate a random number on each loop, this random number will be used to select a movie DIV and change the box shadow color to make it pop.

LFG: Discord bot to find players that want to party up for a game. The bot is trigged by the text "!LFG" and will require an INT of players and the title to a game. "!LFG 4 Dota2."
